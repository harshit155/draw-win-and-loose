# draw-win-and-loose
It's a Rock-Paper-Scissor game, a classic hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible shapes are rock (a fist), paper (an open hand), and scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V).

The rules are:

  *Rock crushes scissors (rock wins)
  *Scissors cuts paper (scissors win)
  *Paper covers rock (paper wins)
If both players choose the same shape, it's a tie(draw), the game is played again.

It's a fun and quick game of chance that can be played almost anywhere with just your hands!
